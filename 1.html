  <p><strong>Let's be real</strong>: Usually, the one "tip" to dressing better or the "secret" that every street style star knows will get her photographed isn't a tip or secret at all. It's money. With money comes fame, freebies, lots of help, and free time, and — voilà! — you've got style. It's easy to be considered well-dressed if you're shopping the designer floor at department stores. It's much harder if you aren't.</p>

  <p>Stylist and image consultant LaTonya Staubs has made a career out of giving women advice about how to revamp their wardrobes or create a new look without operating under the assumption that her clients also have access to a Scrooge McDuck-sized money pit. For the most part, these women have jobs, have responsibilities, have hobbies, and have budgets — but they don’t have a lot of time and money. If this sounds familiar to you, prepare to fall in love with Staubs, who's a mom of two, an entrepreneur, and has a packed calendar that could rival yours.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:40px;">Below, Staubs tells us all about how she puts outfits together that — save for the shoes and accessories — cost her less than $50 each. Plus, she lays out tips about how to continue finding inspiration in your clothes, tips for making normal clothes look not-so-normal, and practical solutions for real-life issues (like how to still look awesome when you've got to lug a stroller up the subway stairs a few times a day).</p>
